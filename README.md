# Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis and Mapping in R

I gave a talk to R-Ladies Chicago on April 26, 2018 about cool new things in #rspatial, like the `sf` and `tmap` packages. Here are the slides from the Meetup!

I'd also like start building the #rspatialladies community, so stay tuned for more regarding this (and reach out if you're interested in helping organize)! Expect a Slack channel in the near future...
